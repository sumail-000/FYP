## ‚ú® Key Features

Academia Hub is more than just a file-sharing app; it's a comprehensive ecosystem designed to enhance the academic journey.

### üìö Core Functionality

- **Advanced Document Sharing**: Upload and access study materials, notes, and assignments.
- **Powerful Search & Filtering**: A sophisticated dashboard allows users to filter documents by university, department, semester, and course. Content can also be sorted by name, date, file size, and more.
- **Multi-File Upload**: A dedicated upload manager allows for selecting and tagging multiple files at once.
- **Intelligent Metadata Management**: The system uses a Levenshtein distance algorithm to check for semantic similarity when users add new metadata (like courses or departments), preventing duplicate entries and ensuring data consistency.
- **View & Manage Uploads**: Users have a personal dashboard to view, edit, and delete their own contributions.
- **File Downloads**: Users can download resources directly to their device for offline access.

### üë• Social & Community

- **Real-time Presence**: See which users are currently online and what they are doing within the app (e.g., "in chat with John Doe").
- **Friends System**: Send, receive, and manage friend requests to build your academic network.
- **Pin Friends**: Pin up to three friends for quick access at the top of your friends list.
- **Public Chatroom**: A general chatroom for all users to engage in community discussions.
- **Private Chat**: Secure, one-on-one messaging between friends, complete with read receipts.
- **User Profiles**: View other users' profiles to see their contributions, stats, and earned badges before connecting.

### üèÜ Gamification

- **Activity Points**: Earn points for performing actions that benefit the community, such as:
  - Completing your profile.
  - Verifying a university email.
  - Logging in daily (with a streak system).
  - Uploading new resources.
  - Connecting with friends.
- **Achievement Badges**: Unlock a series of badges (from "Newcomer" to "Academic Leader") as you accumulate points, showcasing your dedication and contributions.
- **Progress Tracking**: A dedicated screen visualizes your points history, streak progress, and shows you how to earn more points.

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Features
